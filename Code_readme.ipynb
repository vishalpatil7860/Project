    "This code is a comprehensive implementation for creating a machine learning model for recommendation purposes using a dataset, typically of retail transactions. Let's break down the steps and the objective of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loading the Dataset**: The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame with ISO-8859-1 encoding, a common encoding for European languages. It handles any loading errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initial Data Cleaning**: \n",
    "   - Rows with missing 'Description' or 'CustomerID' are dropped.\n",
    "   - Duplicate rows are removed.\n",
    "   - Anomalies like negative quantities or prices are identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Further Data Cleaning**:\n",
    "   - After the initial cleaning, the same steps are repeated with an additional step where a new column 'TotalPrice' is created by multiplying 'Quantity' and 'UnitPrice'.\n",
    "   - The dataset is checked for missing values again.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Feature Selection**: Selects relevant features ('Description', 'Quantity', 'UnitPrice', 'Country', 'TotalPrice') and the target variable ('StockCode') for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Splitting**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with 80% for training and 20% for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Data Transformation**:\n",
    "   - A `ColumnTransformer` is used for preprocessing, which applies StandardScaler to continuous features and OneHotEncoder to categorical features.\n",
    "   - The transformation is applied to both training and test datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Label Encoding**: The target variable 'StockCode' is encoded using `LabelEncoder`.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Handling Unseen Labels**: Filters out labels in the test set that weren't seen during training to avoid errors during model evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Model Building and Training**: \n",
    "   - A neural network model is built using TensorFlow and Keras with two hidden layers and dropout for regularization.\n",
    "   - The model is compiled and trained on the processed training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Model Evaluation**: The model is evaluated on the test set, and accuracy is printed out.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Model Saving and Loading**: The trained model is saved and then loaded for future use.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Saving Preprocessor and Label Encoder**: The preprocessor and label encoder are saved for future use in transforming new data in the same way as the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: The overall objective of this code is to build and train a machine learning model for making product recommendations (likely a retail setting). It involves data cleaning, preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and saving the necessary components for deploying the model in a real-world application. The model can be used to predict the 'StockCode' (which likely represents a specific product) based on features like product description, quantity, unit price, and country of sale. This kind of model is useful in e-commerce or retail scenarios for recommending products to customers based on their purchasing history or preferences.\n"
